Hooks marked with "\*" have minor differences (read below).

## Differences

### useAnimation

To supply a custom easing function just pass it as a first argument:

```javascript
import { useAnimation } from 'use-hooks'

const inQuart = (t) => t * t * t * t
function MyComponent() {
	const animation = useAnimation(inQuart, 250)

	// ...
}
```

### useDarkMode

The class name and element are hard coded on the website but in this package they're changable:

```javascript
import { useDarkMode } from 'use-hooks'

const rootElement = document.getElementById('my-root-element')
function App() {
	useDarkMode('my-dark-mode-class-name', rootElement)

	// ...
}
```

### useHistory

Added `initialValue` to the `clear` callbacks dependencies.

### useKeyPress

A second `useDependencies` argument was added allowing the effect to re-run when arguments change.

### useMedia

A fourth `useDependencies` argument was added allowing the effect to re-run when arguments change.

### useOnScreen

A third `useDependencies` argument was added allowing the effect to re-run when arguments change.

### useScript

Converted an `Array.prototype.includes` call to an `Array.prototype.indexOf` call to support ES5 environments.

### useWindowSize

`isClient` boolean and `getSize` function moved out of hook body.
